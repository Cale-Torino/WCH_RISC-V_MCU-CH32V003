# Programming

To program the CH32V003 microcontroller, you will need a programmer that supports SWD.

The official WCH-LinkE programmer.
Check CNLohr's ch32v003fun project for other options, such as ESP32S2 and Arduino-based programmers.

Wiring the Board to WCH-LinkE

Switch WCH-LinkE to RISC-V Mode
If the blue LED on the WCH-LinkE is always on, it is in ARM mode. To program CH32V003, it needs to be switched to RISC-V mode. Hold the Modes key while plugging it in the USB port.
